# Welcome to my GitHub "website"!

You can view my [GitHub Account](https://github.com/RileyDeraes) here, if you would like to.
I probably won't update this very often, it's only for the code I personally find most interesting.

## My online presence:
I can be found just about anywhere under the name "RileyDeraes".
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!

I'll most likely use one of these two images as my profile picture:

`Please don't steal the images though lol`

_Also I'm just putting these here for fun_

**Interesting, right?**
